Flutter Internship Task:
Create a simple reminder application. A person has to be reminded on the below activities on daily basis in a span of 24hour:
[Day of the week]
Wake up
Go to gym
Breakfast
Meetings
Lunch
Quick nap
Go to library
Dinner
Go to sleep

The UI should be based on only drop-down lists for selecting the day of the week, choose the time and the choice of activities as given below. Once the time is up the app should play a sound / chime.
[Drop-down for day]: [Drop-down for choosing the time (clock widget is preferred)]: [Drop-down containing the list of above activities]
It's best if the given assignment is done using Flutter frame work and Dart.
